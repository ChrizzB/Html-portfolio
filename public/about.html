<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello World,<br><br>
  This is Chris B from Cape Town, South Aftrica. <br>
  </p>

<p> I am learning Web Development with Dr Angela Yu. This is the site where I upload my projects as we progress in the bootcamp. <br>
 For now, the site is still basic and in html, but as time goes, my projects are going to be more complex.
</p>
<p>Hope to learn a lot through other developers on this platform. I am not sure yet how Github works, but I am a fast learner so I should be all set in no time.</p>

<p>To anyone want to connect, do your thing. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p> Cheers,<br>
  Chris B
